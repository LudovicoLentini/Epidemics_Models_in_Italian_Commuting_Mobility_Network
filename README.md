# Epidemics Models in Italian Commuting Mobility Network
Testing how a SEIR Network Epidemic Model would spread in the Italian Network of commuting fluxes. Comparison Between different Italian Regions

## Main parts of the project:
### Italian Mobility network 
Handling the italian commuting mobility network to get a workable graph

### Epidemic model 
Coding from scratch a SEIR Network model

### Exploring properties of SEIR
Handling the parameters beta, gamma and sigma of the SEIR model.

### Testing the spread of an epidemic 
Testing the different behaviours of the spread of an epidemic disease in different sub-graphs of the network:
The Lazio region, the Puglia region and the whole North-Italy region.
